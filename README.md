## Getting Started

There's a mismatch between one of our dependencies, that requires React 17~. We currently are working with React 18~.
To install the dependencies you should run
```
npm i --legacy-peer-deps
```

To run the development server:

```bash
npx next dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
